# EECS_268
2023 Lab Submissions

In the file EECS_268 you will find my lab assignments from the Programming 2 class at the
University of Kansas. Programming 2 carried over on all of the fundamental ideas in Python
learned from Programming 168 such as object oriented programming, implementing functions, and
file I/O. Programming 2 dives into more advanced areas of programming such as node-based
data structure implementation. To name a few that we covered in class: stacks, queues, linked
lists, trees, etc.

Course Description provided by the University of Kansas: This course continues developing problem 
solving techniques by focusing on the imperative and object-oriented styles using Abstract Data 
Types. Basic data structures such as queues, stacks, trees, and graphs will be covered. Recursion. 
Basic notions of algorithmic efficiency and performance analysis in the context of sorting 
algorithms. Basic Object-Oriented techniques.
