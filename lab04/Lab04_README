We continue to learn new data structures and this week was the Singly-Linked List. I created my linked list with several
methods: length(), insert(), remove(), get_entry(), set_entry() and clear(). To implement this linked list, we simulated 
web browswer history. There were a few main functionalities of this implementation. Firstly, we were to keep track of the 
current url even if you navigated behind it. If you were to navigate forward after navigating back then the newly
navigated website would replace what was behind it, just like in an actual web browser.
