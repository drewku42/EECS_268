This week in lecture we continued to learn about node based data strucures. This week, we covered the queue. The queue
methods I needed to create were enqueue(), dequeue(), peek_front() and is_empty(). We built upon what we learned last week 
about stacks to implement a CPU Scheduler. The scheduler is represented by a queue, with several processes represented by
stacks. We would read from an input file and add several processes to the queue. Whatever process was at the top of the 
queue would call several functions. When the process at the front of the queue finished calling its functions, it would
be dequeued and the next process would begin calling. After all processes were done calling functions, the process stack
would return from main and end the final process.
