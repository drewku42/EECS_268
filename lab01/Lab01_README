Lab 1 served as a python refresher where we were tasked with accessing a text file containing around two hundred board games. 
Each board game had a name, year of publication, and several ratings. I created a class to represent a boardgame and used
the built in magic methods, (__eq__, __gt__, __lt__, etc), so I could compare the boardgames to each other. I iterated
through the input file and created a new board game line by line, then added them to a list. From here, we were tasked
to handle user input to print the list of boardgames in order by rating or year of pubication. Another functionality of this
menu was to diaply board games made in a given year, board games within a certain playtime thershold, or games with a minumum
rating.
