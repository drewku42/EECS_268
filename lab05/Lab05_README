This week in lecture we got our first look at recursion. We were given three small recursion exercises to complete for this
week's lab. We learned this low abstraction of recursion as finding a base case, and applying a small 'bite' to the problem
until we found a solution. The first exercise would take a base number and an exponent and recursively solved for the base
to this exponential power. Next was a virus outbreak simulator. We were given the total count of sick people for the first
3 days and had to recursively solve for the Nth day. Lastly, we made a simple implementation of a recursive fibonacci solver.
We had to give either the Nth term of the sequence, or verify that a number was a part of the sequence.
