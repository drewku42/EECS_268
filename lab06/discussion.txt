1) Before starting implementation, design your code base.
Design a class that will be in charge of reading the file.
- Make a list of methods and member variables you think it should have


2) Design a class that, given a valid map, will traverse it.
- Make a list of member variables and method you think it should have.


3) Discuss how you plan to detect the need for backtracking if you reach a deadend in the map.
   What will variables/objects/arrays will need to be updated when you backtrack?


4) Discuss how you plan to detect flooding all possible spaces OR running out of water
