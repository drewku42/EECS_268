After taking a few weeks to learn recursion, we were able to move on to a new data structure: Binary Trees. Understanding recursion was integral since we require
recursion to navigate binary trees. We also needed to define a new type of node, since binary nodes must have their entry as well as 'left' and 'right' members
to represent children within the tree. For lab 7 we were given a text document containing all 151 generation one pokemon with their English and Japanese names, as well
as their pokedex number. I created a pokemon class and provided each of these elments as parameters. I iterated through the input file and made each entry into a pokemon
and added them to the binary tree, which represented the pokedex. We had to implement a menu with a few functionalities: the ability to search the tree for a given
pokemon's pokedex number, the ability to add a new pokemon to the pokedex, and the ability to print the pokedex. We learned in class about different ways to traverse
binary trees, being pre order, post order and in order. We had to have print functionality for each of these traversals.
